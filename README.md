# open_api_project
To execute this code in PyCharm:

Open PyCharm and create a new Python project.

Create a new Python file with the .py extension (e.g., gpt3_task.py).

Copy the code into the Python file.

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your OpenAI API key.

Run the code by clicking the "Run" button or by right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Run 'gpt3_task'"
. The code installs and imports the langchain library, uses OpenAI's embeddings to embed a document, splits the document into three parts, connects to the OpenAI GPT-3 API, asks a question, retrieves the most relevant document based on the question, and generates an answer using GPT-3.
